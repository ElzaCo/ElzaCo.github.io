## Background

Many enjoy general aviation as a hobby and for some, a job. Whether creating videos for Youtube or recording for posterity, an affordable, convenient, and adaptable method of recording aircraft audio is needed.

Products in this realm already exist. Categories of the products include: aircraft specific recording devices and cable adapters with built in circuits. The problem with these products are that they are often expensive and not adaptable. 

## Goal

Devise a way to record audio from aircraft that is:
- affordable: less than $20 USD
- convenient: small, simple operation, easy to transfer audio file
- adaptable: able to change cable lengths, swap jack styles

An ideal scenario to meet these needs would utilize equipment aviators already own in order to keep costs down. Most have phones or tablets capable of recording audio through their audio jack. These devices are also internet connected enabling easy transfer of file to cloud or computer. The only set back is that aircraft audio circuits operate a higher voltage than phone audio so a voltage step down circuit is need. Ideally the cables and adapter circuit will not be permanently joined, but instead utilize jacks.
